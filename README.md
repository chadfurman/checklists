# Web Application Development Checklists

## Checklist Organization

Checklists are organized with folders, but the folder names are flexible.  If you want to add a checklist into an existing folder, then put it there.  Otherwise, create a second folder.  If necessary, use sub-folders.

Possible folder names are included, but subject to change:

 * Back-end // Anything about building out APIs / serving data / back-end languages
 * Front-end // React, Angular, anything related to front-end development and/or best practices
 * Databases // SQL? NoSQL?  Mongo?  Postgres?  MySQL?  GraphQL? Cursors?
 * Security // Automated auditing tools in use? Snort/Bro? Backups? Risk assessment?  
 * Deployment // Deploy on push?  Travis checklist? Updating AMIs?  Cron jobs?
 * Testing // e2e question/Answer style check-list for each page / feature and also unit-level QA for functions
 
 ## Format
 
 Checklists are written in GitHub-flavored markdown.  This enables the use of 
 
 - [ ] <- `- [ ] <- Checkboxes`
